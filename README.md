# Melee Randomizer
Re-experience the magic of Super Smash Bros. Melee at the press of a button! Melee Randomizer digs into a Melee ISO to organize data about the various fighters, then takes that data and applies randomization based on the provided "Flag-set", and provides a brand new unique ISO! This ISO then can be shared with friends and used to play online, or one can simply enjoy playing the game locally with friends at home or at a tournament! From small balance changes to creating crazy whackiness and nonsense, and everything in between, Melee Randomizer is sure to offer something for every kind of Melee player!
