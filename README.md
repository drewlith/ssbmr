# Melee Randomizer
Re-experience the magic of Super Smash Bros. Melee at the press of a button! Melee Randomizer digs into a Melee ISO to organize data about the various fighters, then takes that data and applies randomization based on the provided "Flag-set" to create a brand new unique experience! This ISO then can be shared with friends and used to play online, or one can simply enjoy playing the game locally alone or with their friends! Melee randomizer offers simple and easy-to-use standardized settings for the average user that keep things reasonable and in check. It also offers complete control for advanced users to create and share their own Flags which tell the randomizer exactly what and how things should be randomized! From small balance changes to creating crazy whackiness and nonsense, and everything in between, Melee Randomizer is sure to offer something for every kind of Melee player, both casual and professional!
